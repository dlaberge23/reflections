When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      Remote repositories are useful in a situation where you are collaborating with other people
       or working from multiple machines. As someone who bounces between 3 different devices when
       editing code it makes sense to have my repository stored in a location where it is easily
       pulled to any device. It is also convenient for sharing my work with others and getting feedback.
       
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
      Manually pulling give you more control. There won't be any unexpected changes to you local version. You may be working in a
       repository with a new version of the code, but there may be bugs. I wouldn't want to add those bugs to my local version. I would
       want to wait until the bugs have been fixed.
